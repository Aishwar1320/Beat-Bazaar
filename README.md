# üé∂ Beat Bazaar - Music App with Music Recognition

Welcome to **Beat Bazaar**, a music application that lets users play, explore, and recognize songs using the **ACR Cloud API**. All code, UI, and design were crafted by me, and I‚Äôd love to see others build upon it! If you choose to use or modify this code, please give proper credit.

## üöÄ Features

- **Music Recognition**: Identify songs with the **ACR Cloud API**. Please add your own API keys for this feature to function.
- **Music Player**: Enjoy a built-in music player with an intuitive UI.

## üîë ACR Cloud API Setup

To enable the music recognition feature:
